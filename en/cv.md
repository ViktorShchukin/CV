#### About me

Hi. I'm glad you
noticed my CV. I'm a young
clojure developer, but I'm in
love with programming. I really
like to search and study for new
in this area. And if you have
interesting project which needs
for new member you find the
good one.

I am in studying process now
under the supervision of experienced
mentor. But I already have
some experience and want to
find company which will allow
me to grow as program developer.
