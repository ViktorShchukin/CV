test app that proves the idea. Also, I assisted with the server-side logic.  
Glagol is a project that aims to implement computer

just one camera instead of lidars.

### About me:

I am a young and ambitious developer.
I love programming and work to grow in this field.  
I am inspired by mathematics and science. I can say that currently, 
it is my hobby. But simultaneously while studying at university, I
worked at a chemical research institute. As a result of my work
two scientific articles were made:  
[First article](https://doi.org/10.3390/inorganics10090127)  
[Second article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2022.167637)  
I lead a healthy lifestyle and believe self-discipline is the key to success.
